# Project Plotting - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Histograms, and Boxplots
This project involves performing data analysis on transportation data, focusing on vehicles and fuel efficiency. The goal is to analyze key factors such as CO2 emissions, fuel distribution, and vehicle makes, providing insights into transport systems that contribute to regional and global stocktake discussions on urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following steps:

### Loading the Dataset and Importing Libraries

The dataset was loaded, and necessary libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn were imported to perform the data visualization tasks.
Histogram for CO2 Emissions Distribution

### visualisations 
A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of CO2 emissions across the dataset, providing insights into emission patterns.
Histogram for Fuel Distribution

A histogram was generated to examine the distribution of fuel efficiency, highlighting trends in fuel consumption.
Histogram for Vehicle Makes

A histogram was created to display the distribution of vehicle makes in the dataset, offering insights into the most popular vehicle brands.
Heatmap of Correlation Matrix

A heatmap was generated to visualize the correlation matrix, helping identify relationships between various variables, such as fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.
### Libraries Used
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, including heatmaps and advanced plotting techniques.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
